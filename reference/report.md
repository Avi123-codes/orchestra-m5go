The Project:

	The project consists of five M5GOs, four “players” and one “conductor”. The five M5GOs are attached to each other using the provided connector pieces, as well as six Grove cables and two Grove hubs. The entire frame fits within the space allotted, while barely exceeding the height and width requirements.



Functions:

	The M5GOs are coded to display images, flash LED lights, and play sounds via the built-in speaker system. Each M5GO displays the Tinkercademy logo and mascot, adjusted to fit its orientation. Each M5GO also has the capability to display and change the colour of its two inbuilt side LED displays. While light blue by default, these LED displays have the capability to change to a light green, yellow or purple colour depending on the type of sound last played. 

The M5GO ensemble’s ability to play sounds using the inbuilt M5GO speaker system is its main feature. Utilising the M5GO’s inbuilt ESP32 system, the M5GO ensemble is able to play in sync, and is thus able to play three distinct types of pieces, that being a quintet piece, duets and solo pieces. The LED displays on either side of each M5GO denotes the type of piece currently being played; turning green for quintet pieces, yellow for duets, and purple for solo pieces. There is a total of one quintet piece, two duets and five solo pieces available for play.

LED colours:
Blue: No Song Currently
Green: Quintet
Yellow: Duet
Purple: Solo

Repertoire:

Quintet: Jupiter Hymn from Jupiter, The Planets, Op 32 No. 4, Gustav Holst

IV. Jupiter, the Bringer of Jollity, originally written by Gustav Holst between 1914 and 191, was written for orchestra with choir accompaniment. The M5GO ensemble performs an excerpt of this piece, entitled “Jupiter Hymn”, separately arranged for the string quintet. All five M5GOs play at the same time in this excerpt, lending the sound of this piece a layered and complex feel.

Duet: Canon in D, Johann Pachelbel

Canon in D was originally composed by Johann Pachelbel around 1680 for three violins and basso continuo. The M5GO ensemble utilises an arrangement of this piece for violin duet. Two M5GOs play at a time during this piece. The 1st and 5th part begin the duet, and the sound is taken over by the 2nd and 4th parts. This allows the sound to maintain its stability  by ensuring synchrony and harmony between both playing instruments.

Solo 1 & 2: Fantaisie and Variations No. 11: The Carnival of Venice, Theme and Variation I

This version of the iconic sound The Carnival of Venice was composed by Jean-Baptiste Arban for solo cornet with band accompaniment. This arrangement comprises an intro and a theme, followed by four variations. The M5GO ensemble uses the theme and first variation of this song as solo repertoire; the theme is performed by the 3rd part, where the first variation is performed by the 2nd part. The running semiquavers present within both the intro and the theme lend the piece a sense of fluidity.

Solo 3: Blue Bells of Scotland

Blue Bells of Scotland is a traditional Scottish folk song composed in 1801. The M5GO ensemble utilises an arrangement of this song for solo cornet, which is played by the 1st part. Its moderate tempo and repeated motif make this piece very memorable.

Solo 4: The Medallion Calls, Klaus Badelt

The Medallion Calls is a piece for concert band written by Klaus Badelt for use in the 2003 film Pirates of the Carribean: The Curse of the Black Pearl. The M5GO ensemble replicates a standout section of this iconic soundtrack, its euphonium-trumpet solo section, followed by the song’s ending section and conclusion. The song’s contrasting tones of its grandiose, brassy solos followed by fast, frantic string melodies leads to it being a sound choice for the M5GO’s solo repertoire. This piece is performed by the 4th part.

Solo 5: It’s TV Time!, Deltarune Chapter 3+4

It’s TV Time! is a soundtrack composed by Toby Fox for the game Deltarune Chapters 3+4 in 2025. The M5GO ensemble uses one of its key motifs to present a solo section. This song’s fast and quirky melodies presents a memorable solo piece.
